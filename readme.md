 <p>This web page simulates multipath fading.</p>

                     **Phasor Plot**
                     Each multipath component is represented by a phasor of editable amplitude, intial phase and frequency.</br>
                     Multipath Components are represented by black phasors.</br>
                     The resultant is calculated as the phasor sum of the multipath components and is represented by the green phasor.

                     **Magnitude Plot**</br>
                     The "Show Magnitude" button shows the Magnitude Plot - variation of magnitude with time.</br>
                     There are 2 options - "Voltage (Linear)" and "Power (dB)".</br>
                     The Voltage (Linear) represents the resultant voltage in linear scale. </br> 
                     This is calculated as the component of the resultant phasor on the x-axis, i.e. the cosine component of the resultant.</br>
                     The Voltage (Power) represents the resultant power in dB scale. </br> 
                     The resultant power represents the power calculated using the above voltage, converted to dB.</br>
                     The magnitude plot's color is changed to red during a fade.</br>

                     **Effect on Fading on Audio**</br>
                     The Magnitude Plot has a Play button. </br>
                     This button plays an audio track whose volume is changed proportionally with the resultant power in dB.
                     The volume will be 0 during a fade.</br>

                     **Editor**</br>
                     The number of components and the amplitude, initial phase and frequency of each component can be edited by clicking on the "Edit" button.</br>
                     Change the number of components, if needed, by typing into the text box. The editor is automatically updated to show options for each component.</br>
                     Change the component values as needed. The initial phase has to be entered in degrees.</br>
                     To Save and Run, press Enter or click on Run. </br>
                     To Cancel, click on Close or "X" at top right.</br>
