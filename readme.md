 This web page simulates multipath fading.
 
 **Phasor Plot:**
                     Each multipath component is represented by a phasor of editable amplitude, intial phase and frequency.
                     Multipath Components are represented by black phasors.
                     The resultant is calculated as the phasor sum of the multipath components and is represented by the green phasor.
                     
**Magnitude Plot:**
                     The "Show Magnitude" button shows the Magnitude Plot - variation of magnitude with time.</br>
                     There are 2 options - "Voltage (Linear)" and "Power (dB)".
                     The Voltage (Linear) represents the resultant voltage in linear scale. 
                     This is calculated as the component of the resultant phasor on the x-axis, i.e. the cosine component of the resultant.
                     The Voltage (Power) represents the resultant power in dB scale. 
                     The resultant power represents the power calculated using the above voltage, converted to dB.
                     The magnitude plot's color is changed to red during a fade.
                     
**Effect on Fading on Audio:**
                     The Magnitude Plot has a Play button.
                     This button plays an audio track whose volume is changed proportionally with the resultant power in dB.
                     The volume will be 0 during a fade.
                     
**Editor:**
                     The number of components and the amplitude, initial phase and frequency of each component can be edited by clicking on the "Edit" button.
                     Change the number of components, if needed, by typing into the text box. The editor is automatically updated to show options for each component.
                     Change the component values as needed. The initial phase has to be entered in degrees.
                     To Save and Run, press Enter or click on Run. 
                     To Cancel, click on Close or "X" at top right.
